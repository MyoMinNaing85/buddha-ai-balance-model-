# Philosophical Foundation of BIM

The Buddha AI Balance Model (BIM) is grounded in Buddhist philosophy,
systems thinking, and ethical AI principles.

## Core Inspirations

### 1. Sīla (Ethical Discipline)
BIM enforces ethical constraints as a primary axis.
No intelligence is allowed to operate without ethical grounding.

### 2. Samādhi (Focused Awareness)
The intelligence core emphasizes clarity, stability, and non-reactivity
in data processing and decision-making.

### 3. Paññā (Wisdom)
Beyond pattern recognition, BIM promotes contextual understanding,
long-term impact awareness, and compassionate reasoning.

## Systems Thinking

BIM treats AI as a living system:
- Inputs affect the whole
- Feedback loops refine behavior
- Balance is continuously maintained

This foundation differentiates BIM from purely optimization-driven AI models.
