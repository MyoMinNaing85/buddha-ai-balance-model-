## Core Principles
- Balance between logic and compassion
- Ethical-first decision making
- Human-aligned intelligence

## Model Structure
1. Ethical Axis
2. Intelligence Core
3. Adaptive Balance Layer

## 3. Roadmap & System Integration
- Noble Eightfold Path as balanced operational roadmap
- Continuous feedback and learning loops
- Integration with modern AI systems and CRM platforms
- Scalable model for education, management, and society

## Purpose
This repository defines the BIM core model and will evolve into
implementations, simulations, and applied frameworks.
