# VE ↔ Core Model Mapping

## Overview
This document defines how the Value-Ethics (VE) layer integrates with
the core components of the Buddha AI Balance Model (BIM).

## Mapping Structure

### 1. Ethical Axis
- VE provides constraint boundaries
- Prevents ethically unstable reasoning paths

### 2. Intelligence Core
- VE acts as a guiding value filter
- Aligns intelligence outputs with human-centered ethics

### 3. Adaptive Balance Layer
- VE adjusts dynamically based on contextual feedback
- Maintains balance between logic, compassion, and outcome

### 4. System Feedback Loop
- VE evaluates outcomes post-decision
- Feeds ethical signals back into the system

## Purpose
This mapping ensures that ethical alignment is not an external add-on,
but a core structural component of the BIM architecture.
