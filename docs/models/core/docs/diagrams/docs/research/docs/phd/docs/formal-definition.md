# Formal Definition of the Buddha AI Balance Model (BIM)

## 1. Definition

The Buddha AI Balance Model (BIM) is a conceptual and systemic framework
for designing artificial intelligence systems that prioritize ethical balance,
human alignment, and adaptive decision-making.

BIM is inspired by Buddhist philosophical principles, particularly the
Middle Way, and integrates them with modern AI system design to address
imbalances in purely performance-driven intelligence models.

## 2. Problem Statement

Contemporary AI systems primarily optimize for efficiency, accuracy,
or reward maximization, often neglecting ethical stability, human well-being,
and long-term societal impact.

This imbalance can result in:
- Manipulative decision-making
- Ethical violations
- Misalignment between system goals and human values

BIM addresses this problem by embedding ethical and balance-oriented
constraints directly into the intelligence architecture.

## 3. Core Assumptions

BIM is based on the following assumptions:

1. Intelligence without ethical balance leads to instability.
2. Ethical reasoning must be integrated, not appended.
3. Human-centered values are essential for sustainable AI systems.
4. Balance is a dynamic state, not a fixed rule set.

## 4. Conceptual Scope

BIM is not a replacement for existing AI algorithms.
Instead, it functions as a meta-framework that can be applied across
various AI paradigms, including decision-support systems,
business intelligence platforms, and adaptive learning systems.

## 5. Original Contribution

The originality of BIM lies in its integration of:
- Buddhist ethical philosophy
- Systems balance theory
- Modern AI alignment concepts

This integration forms a unified framework that treats ethics,
intelligence, and adaptability as co-dependent components
within a single system architecture.

## 6. Research Significance

BIM contributes to the field of ethical artificial intelligence by:
- Providing a formal balance-oriented model
- Offering a cross-disciplinary perspective
- Enabling future analytical, simulation, and empirical studies
