# PhD Proposal Concept: Buddha AI Balance Model (BIM)

## Research Title
Designing Ethical and Balanced Artificial Intelligence
Using the Buddha AI Balance Model (BIM)

## Research Problem
Current AI systems optimize performance without sufficient
ethical balance or human alignment.

## Research Objectives
- To formalize BIM as an AI framework
- To integrate ethics within AI architecture
- To evaluate BIM in decision-based systems

## Research Questions
1. How can ethical balance be embedded within AI systems?
2. Can Buddhist philosophy inform modern AI design?
3. How does BIM compare with existing ethical AI models?

## Methodology
- Conceptual modeling
- System architecture design
- Case study evaluation

## Expected Contributions
- A novel AI ethical framework
- Cross-disciplinary integration of philosophy and technology
