# BIM System Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the high-level system architecture of the
Buddha AI Balance Model (BIM).

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Input Layer
- Human intent
- Contextual data
- Environmental signals

### 2. Value-Ethics (VE) Layer
- Ethical constraints
- Value alignment rules
- Harm prevention boundaries

### 3. Intelligence Core
- Reasoning engine
- Learning mechanisms
- Decision generation

### 4. Adaptive Balance Layer
- Dynamic weighting of logic and compassion
- Context-aware adjustment
- Stability maintenance

### 5. Feedback Loop
- Outcome evaluation
- Ethical impact assessment
- Continuous refinement

## Design Principle
Ethics and balance are embedded within the system,
not applied as post-processing controls.
